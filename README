   This project is for PerturbationAnalyzer.

INTRODUCTION

   PerturbationAnalyzer is an open-source plugin for Cytoscape to 
quantitatively analyze the dynamic characteristics of protein-protein 
interaction network. This tool automatically evaluates the propagation effects 
of single perturbation or combinatorial perturba-tions of protein 
concentrations by comparing two different equilib-rium states which governed by 
the law of mass action (LMA). With Cytoscape visualization environment, the 
results are represented visually in an intuitive and customizable way to help 
identify the key proteins which is mostly perturbed or has largest propagation 
scope. The results can be saved or exported into standard format for further 
analysis.

DEPENDENCY

    Cytoscape program directory should be placed into the root directory of 
project. The Ant script build.xml containds all the build details.
